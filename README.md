## Main elements of the project

The project uses Flask framework and consists of the following files:

- **application.py** is the main application covering all the routes, while its helper functions are put in **helpers.py**.


- **HTML files** can be found in the template folder and rely on layout.html as a template. Styling is completed with Bootstrap classes and a styles.css stylesheet. Flask requires that images are located in the static/img folder.
